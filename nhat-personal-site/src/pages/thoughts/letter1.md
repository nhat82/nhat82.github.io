I like staring at you. Not just at your face, but at the way you exist. You care for me like no one ever has, with a gentleness that feels like sunlight on the darkest corners of my room. You are both the calm I didn't know I needed and the fire that makes me feel alive again. Simply being with you has healed parts of me I thought were broken forever. You have touched places I had long buried and somehow, you made them whole again. Every path I've walked, every stumble was leading me here - to you. You don't just make the world brighter - you made it make sense. Loving you — and being loved by you — has been one of the most beautiful experiences of my life.

And beyond what you give to me, I’ve watched you. I’ve seen you carry the weight of struggles most people will never know. I’ve watched you grieve losses, face doubts, and push through storms that could’ve broken you — but didn’t. I am constantly amazed and inspired by you.

Your mind — the way you think, approach problems, ideas, and life itself. You see things differently, teaching me something new every day. Being around you sharpens me, challenges me, and makes me want to see the world through a wider lens. *"asian small eye need wider len to see clearly" -- chuckles at own joke*

You’ve come so far, and I have no doubt you’ll go even further. Your fight is one of the things I love most about you.

We know what we want in life, and we work for it. We talk, we listen, we grow. We help each other through highs and lows. We’re a team - and I wouldn’t want to build this life with anyone else.

And as we keep moving forward, I’m grateful for every moment we share - the good and the bad, the easy and the hard. Because so much of life’s beauty waits on the other side of discomfort. Together, we choose to face it - in our work, our health, and our love. To live intentionally, and to find joy even in the quiet, boring moments… because those too, we share.

Happy birthday, my Trevor. Thank you for existing the way you do. For being my home, my peace, and my rock. I wish you the best health, the best luck, and every good thing this next year has to offer. I’ll be right here, supporting you, loving you. Here’s to more memories, more lessons, and more of this incredible life we’re building together.
