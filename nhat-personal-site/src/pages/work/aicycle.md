## Overview
AI Auto Insurance Company in Vietnam. I was their AI / software engineer intern for summer 2024.

## What I did

1. Finetune and evaluate +5 YOLO models to get the best performing and lightweight model to extract lincense information from images.

2. Auto-create testing data for lincense images.

3. Used OCR in both English and Vietnamese to extract texts. Made automation scripts that help legal service process filings quickly. 
4. Train YOLOv5 models which side of the car user-send images is.

## What I learned
1. Remote work is not my style. Working with a team half across the world means 6am meetings and no seperation between day and night. 
2. Health first. 
3. You can't expect users to always be in the perfect condition to take pictures. We can't always ask them for clean cars, perfect golden hour lighting and amazing photography skills. You have to accommodate that and streamline the process as much as possible for them. 
4. Users can cheat systems fast (E.g uploading screenshots of other people's car instead of theirs. How do you identify that the picture they send was a fake?).
