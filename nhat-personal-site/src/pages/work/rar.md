## Overview
AI/AR Solutions for plant identification @ UMD.
![Example lincense (generated)](/images/group.png)

## Specs
Our client, Dr.Neel from the Plant Sciences department, wants a web-based AI model to identify +1000 plant species on campus. This tool would be used in research field trips, classrooms, and leisure. 

Budget: None. GPU resource: None. Data: Not enough & unlabeled. Previous research project teams have tried but always fell short due to long data labeling/cleaning stage. We also had access to a database of plants' GPS locations and their info (species, subspecies, height, age, etc). 

## What I did 

### Before AR 
I organized client meetings to understand her needs and the problems she's trying to solve more. The team started experiementing with pre-trained models and I made the website for us to test. 

I soon realized that pre-trained models either is too expensive or too low quality. We wanted to get at least 70% accuracy rate. We decided to use the GPS location data to narrow down the prediction results by filtering out plants that aren't near the user's current location. 

I found out about AR (Augmented Reality) technology and its potential in solving our painpoints. 
- Trees change throughout the year. AI models can't identify a plant species based on dead small branches. 
- Training takes too long. 

I researched on my own about the AR tech and lightweight web-based libraries. I coded and tested multiple versions for 2 weeks before showing it to the team.
